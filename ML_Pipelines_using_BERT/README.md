# Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT


## Project Focus and Summary

- Automate a natural language processing task by building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Hugging Face’s highly-optimized implementation of the state-of-the-art BERT algorithm with Amazon SageMaker Pipelines. The pipeline will first transform the dataset into BERT-readable features and store the features in the Amazon SageMaker Feature Store. It will then fine-tune a text classification model to the dataset using a Hugging Face pre-trained model, which has learned to understand the human language from millions of Wikipedia documents. Finally, your pipeline will evaluate the model’s accuracy and only deploy the model if the accuracy exceeds a given threshold.

- Practical data science is geared towards handling massive datasets that do not fit in your local hardware and could originate from multiple sources. One of the biggest benefits of developing and running data science projects in the cloud is the agility and elasticity that the cloud offers to scale up and out at a minimum cost.

- The focus of these projects are on developing ML workflows using Amazon SageMaker, Python and SQL programming languages. I fully recommend you these projects if you want to learn how to build, train, and deploy scalable, end-to-end ML pipelines in the AWS cloud.
