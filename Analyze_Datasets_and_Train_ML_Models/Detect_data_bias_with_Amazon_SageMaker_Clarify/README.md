# Detect data bias with Amazon SageMaker Clarify

### My Quick Lab from Practical Data Science Specializastion, Coursera.

# Description:

Bias can be present in your data before any model training occurs. Inspecting the dataset for bias can help detect collection gaps, inform your feature engineering, and understand societal biases the dataset may reflect. In this lab you will analyze bias on the dataset, generate and analyze bias report, and prepare the dataset for the model training.

**Steps**

    Download and save raw unbalanced dataset

    Analyze bias with open source Clarify

    Balance the dataset

    Analyze bias at scale with a Amazon SageMaker processing job and Clarify

    Analyze bias reports before and after balancing the dataset
