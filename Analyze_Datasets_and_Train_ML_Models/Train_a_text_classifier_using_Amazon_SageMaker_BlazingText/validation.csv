__label__1 "i love this flirty well fitted dress ! quality material !"
__label__0 "so this dress is extremely comfortable but it 's just really awkward . i am on the fence about keeping it my husband loves it and thinks i should . it just draws attention to the belly so any issues after having kids is very noticeable . not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms . very comfortable but not sure if i will keep it ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts . super disappointed !"
__label__0 "runs a size big unless you want it really boxy . felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon . turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one ."
__label__0 "this top is a nice color and soft material but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for . i will return it but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look ."
__label__1 "when i first put this dress on i immediately thought ... oh no i ca n't pull this off . at least not without a cow to milk . but this dress is so comfortable . the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price . the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right . ( i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen . ) fits true to size . i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe"
__label__-1 "it 's sheer the design /print is casual but on silk like material . had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it ! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer ? ? ?"
__label__1 "this cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin but soft and versatile . the cutouts add a nice unique detail . i was worried that the cuts might fray but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying . really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices : )"
__label__-1 "i 'm sure there 's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly was n't me . admittedly i 'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5 ' tall . still for a taller person this shirt runs short for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit . c"
__label__-1 "i bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern when it arrived i was super confused . it 's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos . it 's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch . i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger . i would say order two sizes down . also it hangs like a maternity shirt . i might order it once it 's on sale which it definitely will be but even then am not positive i would keep it ."
__label__1 "fun flirty feminine ! ! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings ! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants ... just love ! ! ! highly recommend . easy to wear ."
__label__1 "this general sweatshirt is cute stylish and can be dressed up or down . a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings ."
__label__0 "the fabric is absolutely lovely on these but very thin . the top part was tighter than usual ( and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size ) and they flare a lot . so the thin tight top was not a flattering look . the rise also felt short . i 'm 5 ' 4 with a 30 inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles . my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on which is never a good reaction ! even if i hemmed them i think these are a miss for me . will be returning . better for"
__label__0 "this is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady . i miss not having to consider those things . the red color is lovely and the dress is modest . i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita ."
__label__0 "i love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso . when i raised my arms up it bunched up all wrong because it 's a very thick sweater ."
__label__-1 "i am typically a small/6 in dresses but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down . it had no shape but hung like a paper sack . the armholes fit perfectly though if i had sized down they may have been too tight . i am 5 ' 6 140 lb i will return too bad because it is a pretty dress !"
__label__0 "i ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model . this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out . it is a whole lot of skirt ! i 'm 5 ' 2 and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up . i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me . it would work on someone taller ."
__label__1 "walked into the retailer store in new york while on vacation and saw this on display . had to try it on immediately and loved the look . received several compliments from customers in the store . it 's beautifully made soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come ! ! you will need to size down cause it runs large . i love it ............"
__label__-1 "beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments . true to size . it 's not thick but it 's very warm ."
__label__0 "i loved almost everything about this skirt . thick and lined and love the buttons . comfortable . the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom presumably from the buttons . i was torn but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back ."
__label__0 "purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself . it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work . the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering . the one problem was that when you raise your arms the sweater also rises to expose your torso . it was returned ."
__label__1 "i purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered . all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry . the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable . the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build . i felt these were in general true to size . no doubt i will wear these all winter ! thanks antro ! !"
__label__0 "i love the look and feel of this easy dress . i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip however i was in between sizes . the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big . this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type especially in a madras plaid ."
__label__0 "i desperately wanted this to work - it 's a beautiful color and overall quality ... it is just so short and wide ( almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat ) . i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side but on my 5 ' 7 frame and long torso it just did n't look right . few extra inches and this could have been awesome !"
__label__-1 "this looks so gorgeous on the model on the site so i ordered it online . it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on . looks like i took a floor rug cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head . the sweater itself is so pretty its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me . i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs . its kind of itchy too . will be returning this asap ."
__label__1 "i received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another ! beware because the color names are confusing . i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the red thinking i 'd get the red colored tee . however the red tee is actually a light orange color . the orange tee is actually a burgundy/red color . i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color because i really do love the quality of this shirt !"
__label__-1 "these are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color . sadly using free and clear detergent on a cold delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy and they are unwearable . this happened once and i exchanged for another pair but i 'll be returning this pair . i 'll be sad to see my favorite color go but there is obviously a defect in the dye used . maybe i 'll try another color !"
__label__1 "dress is darling and well made . however it runs very large . i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp . would be great for taller slim women . the style is so cute . the online picture does not do it justice ."
__label__1 "this is the most flattering shirt -- love the fit and color !"
__label__-1 "this blouse is stunning on the website ; however it is totally sheer which you can not tell from the photo . i was very disappointed and will be returning ."
__label__-1 "this pants the worst short that i ever had ! ! i bought ; this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color ! ! i was really shock definetly will return it to store . fyi i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry ."
__label__-1 "the design and quality were great . i really wanted them to fit but they ran large . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small . unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i wo n't be trying a size down . the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward . sadly these went back ."
__label__0 "i love how different this dress is in terms of the design . it catches light beautifully . the short biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty . but this dress is completely sheer . there is no lining which is very disappointing . i do have a short nude slip that makes this dress work for me . you will need a slip for sure ! unless you are rhianna . the sizing runs a little large i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs . i will re"
__label__1 "i love love love the fit in the corduroy so thought about grabbing these jeans as well . they fit much pretty well just the color was n't quite right . i 'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans and these do n't quite match the coloring in the photo . still debating whether to keep them . love the cuff styling and straight leg fit !"
__label__1 "i was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband but i love them . they feel wonderful yet they are so light . perfect for warm weather . the print takes them from day to night ."
__label__1 "love this blouse . per the previous review there was no problem with my tailoring . it is exactly as shown . i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it . you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the office . i do think it runs a tiny bit small . however it is not short . it 's just quite a fitted piece . i would consider sizing up . i love the look of the medium on me 5'10"
__label__0 "i received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however the color is n't quite yellow ; it has a little green to it kind of chartreuse . i returned the item because it did n't look as good on me as it did on the pictured model . this would probably look better on someone taller than me ."
__label__0 "i liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt . pretty seam down the back and weight of material . i 'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought ."
__label__-1 "in a word .. clingy ... and not in good way . long so you need it to flow not cling . liked the back but front was just too clingy . back it goes ."
__label__-1 "i returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin . i was expecting higher quality especially for the price . i was disappointed . it is a pretty dress and fit great but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper ."
__label__1 "this is a really pretty top . the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on . i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle not stiff . the top is kind of like a swing top there is a lot of fabric but it is just right . the fabric looks rich and lovely . great top !"
__label__-1 "beautiful dress but has an unflattering fit . i purchased an xs and it 's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy ! would be a perfect maternity dress though !"
__label__0 "for the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back . would have been a classier more finished looking garment . if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look ."
__label__-1 "i love the look and feel of the material but it was way too short - i do n't even have a long torso ! sadly it 's going back to the store ."
__label__0 "its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts . it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model . at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away i love it and i just did n't . my husband looked and said it is just a blah color on me . so that maybe part of it . the fabric is nice does n't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace . i am 5 ' ( and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o"
__label__1 "at first i thought this sweater might be too boxy but fastened at the waist it 's very flattering and the collar is face-framing and the coral in particular ( really more of a mango sorbet shade ) is unexpected but cheery for winter . but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets . brought a new puppy home just after christmas and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats . bought it in coral and pink ."
__label__-1 "i felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way . the waistband is very fitted but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips . it 's also see through . fit is tts ."
__label__1 "i love these jeans ! i really like the way they fit and have n't had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have ."
__label__0 "had to send back for exchange . way too big . i 'm very excited to get a smaller size because they are really beautifully made ."
__label__1 "i really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila ' - i love the shorts too ! colors are great and you do n't have to cuff them if they seem too short - they 're versatile and who does n't love options ? ? ? ? ?"
__label__0 "an odd top . for my curvy figure ( 34g ) the seam did not enhance but rather made me look wider . the material is ... interesting . foam-like is all i can think to describe it . the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person ."
__label__1 "this dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile . great for dressing up or down . i am large busted ( 36g ) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover . i am petite 51 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great !"
__label__0 "i really wanted to like these . they 're soft long enough for 5 ' 8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way . have to return ; ("
__label__1 "love this coat - great fall piece ! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture . great retailer purchase !"

__label__0 "i really liked the top once i saw it but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath . the fabric is a little stiff . it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist . the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine but it is a nice top ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress . it runs small ( i 'm normally a 2 ) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room the zippers got stuck a lot . i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in . finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well . i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding . my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up ... and then it broke . the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go . it was awful . i co"
__label__-1 "sadly this has to go back . i am 5 ' 5 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me . very short . and it 's so wide it 's almost a trapeze cut . the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt . which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful the detail is nice in person even the sleeve cuffs are great . i am not very tall and i 'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles loose and tight . the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering ."
__label__1 "unfortunately had to return this . i loved it but just does n't work for my petite size ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater ! it 's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length . i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long like i had hoped . the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo but i actually like that even better ."
__label__1 "i loved the print on both but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel . i went ahead and ordered the cat one today . the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit size down . for myself m was perfect since i 'm built larger and broader on top . the top is a bit long covers my hips and some of my bottom . it 's a mixed fabric design so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types ."
__label__1 "this is a wonderful vest ! i love the lining ! ! keeps you nice and warm ! i love the muted green color ! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest ! !"
__label__1 "i think the fabric is very nice and soft . i find this top runs very large . i am 5 ' 2 130l . normally wear a small in a shirt . i should have ordered xs it is very large . i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size . the shoulder area fits fine . i may try tucking it in . other than size a nice top ."
__label__-1 "the reason for the title above is this skirt does n't wow me . i felt like i could find this anywhere and i do n't go to retailer for such things . they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years .... __________ pros : - tts . i tried on a large ( and i 'm normally either a 10 or 12 ) and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out . - flows nicely ! it does have a great movement to it . - a good everyday skirt . - not sheer at all . it is lined . - when y"

__label__-1 "i loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit . however when i got my pair the flower placement was completely different . the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams . i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong but those were even worse . they looked obscene ."

__label__0 "i had high hopes for this coat but it was a miss for me . while the wool is soft and not itchy the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy . also the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located . i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was but alas i just could not get over the poor tailoring . for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs ) and it was big ."

__label__-1 "i was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer . for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses . the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all . the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown . this dress has no shape to it although probably comfortable not flattering . i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture in person ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater . the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm . i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves . however after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute . one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap . the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo . it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly . yikes ! this ma"

__label__1 "it 's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i ca n't wait for cooler weather . i tried it on with skinny jeans and it 's darling . love how it 's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum . perfect for leggings . nice slim but not tight fit ."

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan . unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach . the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger . the quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long ."
__label__-1 "cute sweater . snap was broken when i received it . and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock . ugh !"
__label__0 "first of all the label on this dress is maeve not nue by shani . second i just was n't impressed . the fabric is cool ... it has a sort of embossed look to it and it 's somewhat shiny which sets it apart in a good way . but the cut is just boring . the top felt dowdy to me ... overall i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited when i ordered this i love comfy clothing this looked perfect ! when i received it there was a weird smell with the top . convinced that this could be from storage or something i washed it . the smell did not go away . i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear ! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it not able to return it . the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell . now i am 'stuck ' ! !"

__label__0 "this is a flattering comfortable soft sweater the instant you put it on . a few instants after that however i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity . i 'm not optimistic about its longevity and would n't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer ."

__label__-1 "the top of this suit was not proportioned well . i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium . the cup size on this was very small for a medium . the band to hook in the back was almost too big . there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup . the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back ."

__label__0 "i agree with the other two reviews . it is so disappointing that this adorable dress is n't lined . the fabric is paper thin ! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy . i sized down to a petite xs . i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it . i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size ."

__label__-1 "i wanted to like this dress but it just did not work for a bustier frame . the fabric is quite loose does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy so if you are well-endowed your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs . as a result the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips ( as on the model ) and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward . on smaller curves this would likely be very flattering but"

__label__1 "if you love the boho style then this too is for you . it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans leggings sandals boots and booties . i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall . it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and bought the pm but needed the ps . i have recievied tons of compliments and i 'm thinking of getting the silver one too !"

__label__1 "i received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe ! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends . a great value if you 're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together . i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing ."

__label__0 "i 'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much . it 's completely different then how it looks on the model . it 's much shorter which others do mention but it flares a lot . enough to feel maternity-ish on me . it looks fitted on the model . maybe it 's my shape i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips . i ordered an xs too . i will say the material is very nice and it 's well made but it 's going back ."
__label__0 "this dress has great potential . i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off . as a previous review stated it 's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree the hem is also funky . i am still deciding if i want to keep it but if i do i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0 ."

__label__0 "i agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap . i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i 'd like the slits but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe . true to size ."

__label__0 "very cute top and nice material but the fit is strange . there 's a reason that the model has her arms at her side . the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small but the body is very loose . the sleeves are full probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected . also the arm hole is wide so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt which creates an awkward silhouette . i normally love designs by whit but i 'm not sure about this one"

__label__-1 "woah these jeans looked ridiculous on me . i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom 's closet . the combination of the light wash the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no . it really accentuates any pouch you may have . i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering . i am 5 ' 3 / 140 curvy . no no no !"

__label__-1 "the dress ran big but is tight at the bust material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off . you ca n't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress ."
__label__-1 "i 'm so incredibly disappointed . the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing . poor quality control ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this . i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock . i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer . unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange . it cut my off in the most unflattering spot ."

__label__-1 "this dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it . i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available . the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed . however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky . i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering ."
__label__-1 "this dress looked gorgeous light and lacy in the picture but when it arrived the lace that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive . the inner sheath was made of a heavy sequined material . it was uncomfortable scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail . it also added bulk to the dress so that i looked ten pounds heavier . i ca n't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip . the si"
__label__0 "i loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it . however the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i 'd even worn it so i thought it would probably only get worse . too bad because it 's gorgeous and flattering !"
__label__-1 "as another reviewer pointed out although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water the color around the popsicles will bleed ! this is extremely disappointing . i 'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover or that retailer will take this item back . would only dry clean this item ."

__label__-1 "this top was a big disappointment . i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well but one was cut much smaller than the other . i 've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops . i do n't understand why in size 14 & 16 this keeps happening . that 's why i purchase two of each . usually one fits and the other does n't . this time unfortunately neither worked . they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders"

__label__-1 "when i ordered this dress i thought to myself hmm it seems a little close to showing some side boob but maybe that 's just the angle of the photo . flash forward to me trying it on in my home - yep that 's some side boob . it is very low cut under the arms . if you 're super slim this might be a good look but on a curvy gal with some boobs it was obscene . also i 'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands so i ordered a l and an xl just in case . the xl would n't even zip up . returning ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me . the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired . the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big . the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top . for reference i am 5'10 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top . i think an xs would have been to"

__label__0 "this top was so pretty online ! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person though the back was gorgeous with a button gather at center . the color appeared yellow online but was a bit more green in person . also the armholes were very low so it would need a camisole or no bra ."

__label__0 "this is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder . i guess the material was a little too thin .... $ 98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily !"

( i usually wear a 28 or 29 and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs . ) unfortunately the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray . and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion . i will be returning them ."
__label__0 "i ca n't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted ( if so it 's too big but the length works ) or if it 's supposed to sit on my hips ( fits well but too long ) . but the material is really comfortable and the design is different in a good way ."
__label__-1 "i thought the dress was ok but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress . i will send back also a bit too high waisted for me . other than that the dress is as it appears ."

__label__0 "i love the style of this top . i just wish there were a slimmer version of it . unfortunately this top does n't suit my long slim midsection . it is so wide it completely hides the waist . i think it would look adorable on a different body type ."

__label__-1 "i love the design of this top however it 's quality is lackluster . the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering ( at least on me ) if it had a few more inches . also it 's pretty sheer so figuring out under garments is a dilemma . i will still wear it because i love it . looks great with a denim vest over it !"
__label__0 "i have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans and have loved them all ! ! ! these unfortunately i do not like . i think they run large and the fit just blah . the waist gapped and kinda had a mom jean look . i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand ."

__label__1 "finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky . these fit the bill ! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these . look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture . the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived . i sized down a size and the fit is perfect . highly recommend !"
__label__1 "this top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased . i really love it . it is different than i thought it would be . i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow . definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large . definitely recommend ."
__label__1 "i love this top . the quality is excellent . the blouse is lined and falls nicely .. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans . the color is described as orange but it really has more of a bronze tone . looks very rich and exotic . it 's perfect top when you want to wear jeans but want to dress it up a bit ."

__label__-1 "this dress is not flattering . the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy . like the other reviewer said its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through . it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it did n't help regardless . the length is not accurate either . i would say it 's a pretty short dress ( mid thigh ) but that probably depends on the person . it also makes you look very horizontal . i was really excited about this dress but it 's getting r"

__label__-1 "i do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things ! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person it just looks awful ! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn . it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall it is just a wrinkly mess . another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree . it looks very shabby . it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon"

( i ended up with the 12 ) . i wear a 32 dd bra so usually braless is not an option but this actually offers enough support . and if i do want to wear a bra it 's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it . it 's super flattering and really fun to wear out day or night ."

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."
__label__-1 "this is a pretty dress but the cut is quite boxy . i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then flare out more around the waist down to the hem ; however the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down which lends to a rather unflattering look ."

__label__-1 "unique print but not great execution . the pant legs are very tight i have average sized calves and i sized up one size . the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp . when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color . too bad this did n't work out ."
__label__0 "i loved the color and the neckline was flattering . however it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5 ' 3 and a 32f . it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long . also did n't think the fabric was good quality for this price ."
__label__1 "this is an absolutely fabulous skirt . i cant wait to wear it . the biggest challenge is finding the best way to accessorize it . i am an artist and have lots of clothing but have n't created that ab fab combo yet . i will ! ! ! !"
__label__0 "i love the feel and quality of these pants however they ran super big ! they would not stay up around my waist unfortunately ."
__label__1 "i 'm 5 ' 5 145lbs and i 'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor . i bought this shirt in a red medium and love it . yes it 's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it 's meant to be a bit big . i 've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it . this shirt washes well per instructions did n't shrink or loose it 's shape and i 've washed it three times now . i 've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is love"
__label__0 "i like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it . however i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable . there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating . also would not recommend if you are busty . because of how the stripes run it looks stretched out over my chest ."
__label__1 "i love this jacket . it 's easy to dress up or be casual . the black is more like a very dark grey ."
__label__0 "this skirt is not what i was expecting at all . for starters it runs large i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so but it was a good two inches too big and therefore would n't lay flat and gaped at the front . no bueno . my biggest gripe though is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture . they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled the background color of this skirt is not even close to"

__label__0 "this dress fit perfectly i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well . i do however think that the dress is over priced . for as often as you would wear this dress ( given that is n't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once ) i think the price is way too high . a must have on sale or clearance but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination we will see t"

__label__-1 "i was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which is n't my first choice . that was the least of the problems with this jacket . i love sparkle and i love beautiful detail none of the elements by themselves was a problem . the sum of the parts did n't work though . the end result was an unflattering confusing mess . the silhouette plus the frayed edges plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast plus the zipper were just too many things to go t"

__label__0 "i bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is . this is a warm and cozy sweater more bulky than oversized . pattern has a comic book-style art look . it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist . cute warm sweater for winter -- wore with an undershirt ."
__label__1 "these pants are a life saver . i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink rolled in a towel and hung dry with good results . picro does not usually fit me well these pants are the exception . i 'm 5 ' 6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length . great for a baseball game ! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them ! ! ! !"

__label__1 "i just bought these in store . so great looking . however i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long . like 6 inches too long . so i 'll hem them though based on the review that mentions shrinking i might wash them first to see what happens . great for summer in the city ."
__label__0 "i ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large . i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist but even so it was still quite loose . the fabric is very stretchy and thin and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model . for reference i am 5'-7 155lbs usually wear a medium/8 in a top . this medium was too large ."

__label__0 "this is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice . what is wrong is the cut of the skirt . one side bells out more than the other giving it an off center look from the front . my legs were not centered ."
__label__-1 "yikes . there is a whole lot of skirt here . i am 54 weigh around 120 lb and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing depending on the designer . this skirt balloons out from the waist . on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist . i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking . the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf . there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect . definitely returning ."
__label__0 "without seeing the 'online exclusive ' notation i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium . once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they do n't carry it in stores i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium . i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray ... this sweater was right up my alley . i was very disappointed when i decided to return it . first of all i d"
__label__0 "this cute dress was very nice on . however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves . the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms . i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same . other than that the colors and dress are beautiful ."
__label__1 "i actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from ! after ordering this dress i could n't be happier i love it ! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely ."

__label__0 "love the top design not so much the fabric . i should 've read the top was 100 % polyester . returning and finding a better quality top ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this dress but the bell sleeves were enormous ! if you 're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings . the rest of the dress was beautiful though and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure . i would recommend sizing down as the dress runs large ."
__label__1 "falls beautifully and the color is vibrant . can be dressed up or worn casually . texture adds even more uniqueness . a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features ."
__label__-1 "i thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt . not at all ! i 'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight . it is more fitted . if you are looking for something more comfy do n't buy . however if you want more of a fitted blouse feel then go for it ."
__label__-1 "i am 5 6 ' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs . the sweater is enormous . the material is also scratchy and not soft at all . i 'm disappointed with retailer 's sizing this year . i 've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge . really disappointing ."
__label__-1 "this is much prettier online than on me . too much dress even though i sized down ."
__label__-1 "did n't like the dress . look pregnant in it . this dress is going back ."
__label__-1 "i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is . they were n't exaggerating ! ! ! ! the small was way too big for me and the xxs and xs are already sold out . beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured . it is going back for me !"
__label__1 "this dress is perfect for any occasion it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on ."
__label__-1 "top is completely see through . i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like . it is a cute design but not practical at all ."
__label__0 "material is nice . design would be so great if it did n't fit so large ! i am 5 ' 4 118lbs athletic build . the dress could be belted i think ( a very slim girl at retailer did this ) but it is not worth $ 158 in my opinion . if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it however it is not flowy . it fits okay in the shoulders almost too loose and the rest looks like a potato sack . so disappointed ! !"
__label__-1 "this may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried . the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo absolutely garish . the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties it just looks cheap . the skirt is an antebellum nightmare . i did not even want to try it on it 's that bad . i considered adding a photo but was too horrified . for reference i 'm 5'10 approximately the height/ size of the model but it was shorter than the photo depictes . i wanted to like it"
__label__1 "absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding . it is so well made and luxurious i feel amazing in it ! even more gorgeous in person"
__label__1 "like other reviewers i 'm glad i sized down . this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality lightweight chambray . i love that it has pockets but they do puff a bit at my hips ."
__label__-1 "the pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny 's wardrobe on the set of big love . and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman ."
__label__-1 "wanted to love this dress bit it was n't to be . strange fit and does n't drape nicely as in the photo . also the blue color was much darker in person . would n't recommend ."
__label__1 "looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look . i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly . the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium ."
__label__0 "nice jeans just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them . that 's why i returned them . otherwise fine ."
__label__-1 "sizing is just getting unreasonable and nothing fits unless it 's a crew neck nowadays . this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model but on my 5 ' 4 115 lb frame the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim . additionally the shirt looked like it shrunk in length and would n't have covered a belt on my pants . it also did not match the product description and measured 22 from the hps to hem . i 'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i"
__label__-1 "this dress fits awfully . it 's not short as pictured in photo . it hit just above my knees . it looked like sack . i would 've also felt like i was choking all night with it clasped around my neck . it potentially may look okay on someone who is very tall skinny and lanky but i have my doubts about that too ."
__label__-1 "material was a tad rough for my liking . the color did nothing for my olive complexion . given the price of this shirt ( even with 20 % off ) i do n't think it 's worth it . if i 'm spending $ 100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one ... going back ."

__label__0 "this is a beautiful looking dress but definitely runs wide and long . i 'm 5 ' 4 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up . if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked even though i normally never go with petites . it is a gorgeous dress and would probably work on those ladies who are taller ."
__label__1 "purchased this t-shirt in white . it 's lightweight and slightly sheer . perfect for layering . looks cute with a poncho blazer or on it 's own . really wish it was available in black ."
__label__0 "i wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return even on sale price : ( agree with previous reviews : bodice too tight neckline too high/chokes fabric is rough outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas . too bad ... so sad !"

__label__-1 "... for the model to look like this ? pros : nice quality . the colors of the blue version at least are rich and beautiful . note that the dark color pictured is really brown not black . the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture . it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter . it is layered over a bright navy poly slip . cons : i am 5 ' 8 135 # . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med . the sleeves were more dolman than fitted . i imagin"

__label__-1 "i ordered this dress online . the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small particularly in the waist . i normally wear a 0 or 2 but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c . i liked the look but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric . additionally the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out . i returned it immediately ."
__label__0 "this dress caught my eye online and i had to have it . when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered . beautiful vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty swishy fabric . unfortunately the cut was really strange . after reading several reviews i went with an xs but i 'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having . while everything from the waist down fit perfectly the arms were cut too tight the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up . an"
__label__0 "i tried this sweater on in the store . i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine and would be a great causal layering piece . however there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater . not to mention unless you 're built very narrow the pockets will fall at and accentuate hips and not in a flattering way . the nice details are the feel of the knit the layered style with a cottony lined hood and faux lay"

__label__1 "i have featured a picture below . i 'm 5 feet 120 lbs . i ordered an xs petite . i 'm pretty busty so i do n't like a loose fitting top so ordering a size down did the trick . it 's super soft one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element . i 'm enjoying wearing the top ."
__label__0 "this jacket is beautiful . the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect . however one i put it on i could n't wait to get it off . it 's so itchy ! ! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable . especially around my neck . i would n't recommend this jacket based on the material alone . also the jacket runs large . i 'm 5 ' 1 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small . i would definitely size down ."

__label__0 "this is a beautiful dress . all that 's missing is a bonnet !"
__label__0 "bought in white . it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear . the white is pretty sheer . will return ."
__label__0 "i was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look . i am usually an xs or s depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it does n't drape well . i barely got my arms into the sleeves . i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child 's size ? i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off . size up 1-2 for comfort if you have to have this girl . i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try . returned . for ref :"
__label__1 "i really feel in love with the details of these joggers and they did not fail me when they arrived . i have n't worn them yet but tried them on and they seem like nice little relaxed wear with a tee shirt . i can see them being worn with a cami in warm weather or a relaxed tee shirt in a variety of colors . all in all very versatile and i recommend them ."
__label__0 "i like how this jacket is very versatile . you can wear it to work or play . it does have interesting detail on it i kept it based on the price and those details . i have the olive color . the arms are a little tight ."
__label__0 "absolutely love these pants ! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe . i have worn them at least once a week . the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart . given the leather i 'm not sure if they can be fixed . these are fabulous but the quality is just not there . very disappointing ."
__label__-1 "when i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute ! i love the floral detail . unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person . it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure . it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture but it did not look good completely tucked out . i was also not a fan of the fabric . in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is . the front is more polyester and is a little dressier but not what i envisioned . t"
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight . the material was a little itchy on me ( but maybe its because the chest was tight ) . the color is lovely ( pink ) . im sure someone will love it but if you are petite i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty ."
__label__0 "the fit on these is good for my hourglass shape and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too . i bought . a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these . i am going to return these and see if they have something better but will only buy in store from now on ."
__label__-1 "remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties ? ! that 's exactly what this sweater is . everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere . i 'll pass on this !"
__label__0 "after reading other reviews i ordered a small . my usual size is a m. it was huge all around . it 's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top ."
__label__-1 "this material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless . it was not flattering at all on my shape . i do n't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest ."
__label__0 "sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured . no ruffle such a bummer sleeves are much longer and yes it 's teared in the front and back . also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger in my opinion . i 'll most likely keep it but consider the mentioned if buying ."
__label__-1 "this dress was really odd . i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that 's about it . the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large . i was just very underwhelmed with this dress . also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution . overall its okay just hated it on me ."
__label__0 "this top is very cute but i found it runs small in the bust which is unusual for maeve . i will have to return it . you may want to size up if you have a generous bust ."
__label__0 "this sweater is ok. i love love love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect . i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring but once it arrived i knew i had to return . the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection . i like my sweaters more flowy . if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once . also it 's a bit itchy for me-but i 'm rather sensitive and if i 'd loved this on"
__label__0 "i hoped from the picture that this would be more of a straight down sort of fit . retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them . however the top had too much of a flare out bell-shaped vibe . i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those . i think it would only work with jeans/trousers . my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut"
__label__0 "there is n't much shape to this dress . it 's fairly straight from top to bottom . i 'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped . the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much . i 'm 5 ' 2 and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference . also i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it ."
__label__-1 "i bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple .. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever ! i let my sisters try it on too to see if they wanted it or liked it better but it was awful on them as well . i ordered the xs in blue . it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering . i am 5 ' 7 ' and 115. i love swing dresses i just do n't think is cut well ."
__label__0 "i saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice . however the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small . also the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling .... i had to return this jacket ."
__label__0 "i love these jeans but they run small . i recommend ordering one size up ."
__label__0 "i 'm a consistent size 6 ( ordered a small ) with a pretty athletic build ( wide shoulders and strong arms ) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions . the sleeves and back were far too tight . additionally the bow did not cover my bra strap likely because it is n't made for someone my height . had to return ."
__label__0 "i ordered this top online and was hoping to love it however it did n't fit me properly ... the arm holes were much too large ( i 'm typically an xs or small ) i ordered the small and based on this fit i do n't think the extra small would 've fit either : ( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin .... and with 3 kids always hanging on me i do n't think this top would last very long ..."
__label__0 "i loved this dress ... until i washed it . the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry ... which i did ( washed on delicate ) . now it 's not the same dress . it 's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it . i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved . just kind of annoyed . so it 's an awesome dress just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it ."
__label__0 "i ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy . it seems to easily wrinkle though . just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose . unique design ."
__label__1 "these are the best trousers i have bought in a long time ! i 'm 5 ' 8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist -- not enough to size down . i love that they are not skinny -- so over the skinny fit . i plan to wear these with black heels white tee and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time -- oh and a statement necklace -- always a statement necklace . these are a must for every fall wardrobe ! more pants like these please !"
__label__-1 "maternity like and although the back is really cool there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear/pajama . returned ."
__label__0 "i really really wanted to love this jacket . unfortunately i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me . it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer . i am 5 ' 6 but long waisted . this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature . it was beautiful ( although the buttons were cheap ... )"
__label__0 "i need t-shirts these seem cute . a small runs loose but it 's comfortable and it does fit . i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand 's printed tees . if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist because these shirts are cut generously the little slits just throw the whole look off . i tried a few in the store but left them all there ."
__label__0 "this is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front . gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking . however if you have shapely hips and back-side this will definitely emphasize that . had to take it back . a little bit much for work and other formal/professional events . however if you 're less endowed in that area it might work well . gives a great shape !"
__label__0 "i 'll start by saying that i loved this dress . i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it . the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft . i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did . i 'm 5 ' 1 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great . the first time i pulled it out at home i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side the zipper seam split . i tried for a half hour to get it to realign . i finally decided to go exchange it for"
__label__-1 "i loved this coat in the picture and could n't wait to get it . sadly it did not deliver in real life . i got my usual size small and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves and okay in front . the big problem was the back . it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape and a lot of extra fabric . i considered trying the xs but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable and honestly i ca n't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work . maybe i got a defectiv"

__label__-1 "i wanted to love this shirt so much ! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black . the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off . keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together . needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back . retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem but i wanted to give the fair warning !"
__label__-1 "the quality and fabric are fabulous but it 's just too voluminous for my figure ( 5 ' 8 155 lbs ) would look great on someone more slender ."
__label__0 "the picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors . when it came it was more black with some orange that popped . much different then i expected . the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only . i sent it back ."
__label__-1 "this dress really was huge and not at all flattering . i do n't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture . material was nice and soft but i really do n't see how anyone could look good in this no matter what your body shape is ."
__label__0 "i like this top but unfortunately i will be returning . it 's way too long . the color is pretty as is the design minus the length . it makes it look frumpy . maybe if they offered it in petite or if you 're taller it would work for you ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy . it did not look flattering and will be going back ."
__label__-1 "i love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful however the top is way too large . i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops so i ordered the size s there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top . i know if i order an xs i will have the same problem . below the bust the top is not flattering and it & amp ; # 39 ; s a shame ."
__label__1 "i disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality and while it was n't lined i do n't think lining is typical in a sweater material . i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape . i usually wear a 6 or 8 but my store only had a 4 available . it fit but was a little tight in the hips . the skirt was also longer on me then on the model but i 'm on the short side ."
__label__0 "i ordered an xl because most retailer button ups i need a 12 and sometime 14 due to my shoulders and chest but this was huge ."
__label__0 "i ordered a six 6 petite . the pant leg was still very long . and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare . this is a slim fit . i have heavy thighs and this was not for me . i 'm 5 ' 120 lbs . also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing . which i do n't get because it 's spandex blend . also was n't too hip in the zipper on the back ."
__label__-1 "my favorite colors are purple and green so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves i was was blown away . i was disappointed by the bottom of it just huge flowy green fabric with no design on it whatsoever . i went with my first impression and bought it but now that i 'm trying it on in the house i 'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse . i 'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t"

__label__-1 "i 'm not sure what it is with ag . i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans in blue black and white denim . i wish i could say they 're all great but unfortunately there 's a big variation in how they wash depending on the fabric content . i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring but after washing them once i can see they wo n't be a favorite pair . even with cold water and hanging them to dry the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes . at this price po"
__label__1 "this is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days . great fit ; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon soft cotton with great details . im 5 ' 8 140 ish and the medium fit great . i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now ! the white was to sheer for my taste though"
__label__1 "i really love this shirt for its versatility . it looks casual with jeans and dressy with a skirt or even jeans and heels . the shirt itself is super soft . it 's boxier than it looks in the picture but not to the point of crop-top . the shirt still hits at my hips ."
__label__1 "i ordered the green black and ivory because i thought they were so cute . the sweater is short but still cute . the ivory one i will return though . it has sparkle that 's not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric . i 'm actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition ."
__label__0 "i bought this a few weeks back . when i saw it ( the blue one ) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like . i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips typically they do n't . i love the side buttons . i wear mine opened half way . my only complaint is i 've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily . i still li"
__label__0 "i love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears -- very detailed . it is both subtle ( not cheap looking ) and special . as an earlier reviewer noted the top is not see-through a plus . the drawbacks though mean that i will be returning this top . 1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well . i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose even in that size and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives"
__label__0 "got this for my daughter for christmas . she loves the boho peasant look . i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow . although the fabric quality and texture is lovely ( more substantive than i expected ) she just could n't like the top with the color being so off . disappointing as picture makes it much prettier ."
__label__-1 "very disappointed . the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it . i 've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing ."
__label__0 "love the top . love the color . love the back detail . as a larger chested woman the shape was lost a bit . but i just could n't resist ."
__label__1 "nice stretchy shirt . nothing special so i would n't pay more than sale price ."
__label__0 "i loved the actual design on the fabric . the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them but the fabric was much too thin for me . i was surprised because another review said they were thick . to me it felt like tights material almost . however they were not see through which is great . overall they just did n't look great on my body . 5 ' 9 size 6/8 curves medium was a bit too loose ."
__label__-1 "the dress is beautiful in pictures but all the reviews are dead on ... it was full of snags when it arrived ! 8 snags to be exact . and the fabric was heavier than i expected . sadly had to return ."
__label__-1 "i see all the amazing reviews and on one hand i agree with them . but these pants do run huge and they do n't fit tailored like on the model . on me they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they 're super wrinkly . you 'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i 'm surprised to see the comment saying they 're wrinkle resistant . they are n't . also the kahki is more grey which i do n't love . i got these on sale but even at $ 50 i just ca n't justify keeping them . they 're super comfy but"
__label__-1 "i thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high . in fact two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid . however as we were looking at the items we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality as the previous reviewer noted . therefore none of us purchased the pants . the staff at the store were very helpful"
__label__-1 "i saw this in the store and was glad i did n't order it earlier online . i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person . i like more unusual and flattering pieces and this just was n't it . no compliments here ."
__label__1 "these crops are very well proportioned and fun . the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options . i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have . i usually need to order cropped pants in tall but these worked with the regular inseam ."
__label__1 "i love this vest and could not leave without it . the color and lining just make it perfect so stylish and comfy ! i 'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect . the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down . i am big on the bottom the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest ! love love ..."
__label__1 "i bought this skirt for an end of summer caribbean party . the floral detail is even more fun in person . it looks great with a red top or black tank ."
__label__1 "love this shirt ! i have it in both colors . you can wear it off the shoulder or on . it 's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough you could n't see i had drains underneath my tank top . i am really grateful for this shirt ! super soft super cute !"
__label__-1 "looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment both the colors and style . the material seems great quality but it 's stiff and scratchy the style is very boxy and as another reviewer said just hung . i 'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me . back it goes ."
__label__-1 "very poorly made- wide and short very unflattering . the material is advertised as cotton but it felt very synthetic ."
__label__-1 "i took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs . i am 5 ' 6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them they were hugh even the xs ! they looked like a halloween costume . even at the discounted sale price awful and kind of made me laugh . but i guess that 's why they are still available at this sale price ."
__label__1 "love this shirt can dress up or more casual . wish i would of purchased all colors !"
__label__0 "this style is very pretty and flattering . i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design"

__label__-1 "i loved these pants . the fit well and were flattering . unfortunately after three wears they came apart at the seam . very disappointing and frustrating ."
__label__1 "love the design ! fabric is very light and flowy . i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage . runs a little wide . size down . such a fun top i 've had tons of compliments ! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small ."
__label__1 "i purchased this dress in my normal small size - via online . i exchanged it it for a medium in the store as the shoulders were just a little too tight for me . i plan on wear it with tights/leggings as it 's a little to short on my 5 ' 9 frame . well made and the bodice has so much detail but not over the top ."
__label__1 "just tried this on in store . the color in the photo is wayyyyy off . it 's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag . for maeve it runs large . i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best . i 'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust . will pick up when on sale ( bc a hundo for rayon is laughable ) ."
__label__-1 "a good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes . i mix them with my basics scarves and jewelry . so i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses even though i felt it was pretty pricey . when it arrived i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric . it does nothing for any of my intended clothes so it is going back asap ."
__label__-1 "i saw this dress online and really wanted to love it ... unfortunately it was n't at all as expected in person . as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store . the neck was extremely tight ; a problem i 've never encountered with any retailer dress . additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line which protruded in an unflattering way . the pocket is not at all not"
__label__-1 "i should have heeded the previous reviewer 's advice . but i 'm really short so i thought i 'd give it a try . there is something really wrong with the bust . first it 's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be . the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust . even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups they are really only designed to fit cones not curves . from the side it looked hideous . too bad because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous ."
__label__0 "ahhh i should have listened to previous reviews . indeed this top runs very large . style wise it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer ."
__label__0 "i tried this on in my regular size and a size up . just did n't work in either . the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough . i did not purchase it ."
__label__1 "i love these jeans ! i wear them all the time . i love the way they fit and the price is great . please make these exact pants in more colors !"
__label__0 "this dress is stunning . it is a great classic that i wished had worked out for me . i went through 3 different dresses and each time the cap sleeve would tear . there is not much room if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing . i am so disappointed . it wasn ' even tearing on a seam ( so there was no way to repair it ) . if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner it would most likely work .... it is not for a wedding with dancing !"
__label__-1 "this is a beautiful kimono but just is n't made well . the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable . after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling it is going back for good . such a shame !"
__label__1 "these are very cute but very very stiff . have washed 3x and still not relaxing . not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear . my waist is smaller and generally have gap in waist to get fit right in hips . super cute with sandals mules duck boots ."
__label__1 "needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored tops . hei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint . they fit like a glove and are true to size . i do n't think the picture does them justice . if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants . you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer . i would not hesitate to purchase them ."
__label__1 "these pants are beautiful and so comfortable . the liner is a nice surprise . they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket . i 'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale !"
__label__0 "thought this looked so cute especially for averting frame . it arrived and was too large the fabric felt super cheap and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent .... and not in a good way . returned ."
__label__1 "just received yesterday & i love this skirt ! it 's crazy soft very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate . great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath . sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves . only annoyance is it 's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit . you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk . i bought a m in gray which fit perfectly ( i 'm 5 ' 9 & usually a 6 ) . t"
__label__-1 "it 's a cute topper . it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms and because of the a-line through the bottom . but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i do n't have a big chest . the fabric is very scratchy and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped and i suspect it had been worn . going back . not tracy reese 's best piece ."
__label__1 "dress is very flattering on not tent-like at all !"
__label__0 "while i loved the sleeves on this sweater ( the lace detailing was beautiful ) the core area was really big . i agree with another reviewer who said it looked like a maternity top . i was hopeful but i sent it back . i am 5 ' 7 128lb and ordered the small ."
__label__-1 "i love this top ( so cute and comfy ! ) but i wore it twice washed it once on gentle and layed to dry ..... now there are 2 small holes in the front . for as much as it cost i would have expected it to be more durable . very disappointing especially since i do n't live near an retailer and ca n't take it back easily ......"
__label__-1 "i was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather . as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around the back has mesh strips that are see through ! there is also no lining to go with this skirt . if you go back to the back view picture on the website and zoom in closely you can see the model 's black underwear ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in white and it 's quite sheer . as others have noted it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which does n't work on my figure . if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic or less voluminous it could have worked but nope ."
__label__-1 "this is a very awkward and unflattering shirt . i am very petite -- 90 pounds and 5 ' 2 . the arms fit -- length and width but nothing else about this fit . the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath . it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs . yikes ! it looks cute on the model but not on me . the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top ."
__label__-1 "absolutely beautiful top worn once ... hand washed and that 's all she wrote .. ruined ! ! the black trim bled all over the top ! ! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal ! do not recommend ! ! : ("
__label__-1 "hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length ."
__label__-1 "the overall styling was great and the dress is super-cute if a little thick ( it 's made of denim after all ) . i ordered a size down from my normal and even then i was swimming in it . the worst part and the aspect that will make me return it is that the arm holes hang down so low that i 'd have to wear a tank top under the dress . i 'm returning it though it is really cute and i love this brand . the arm holes killed it for me ."
__label__1 "i love this crushed velvet dress in the rich blue color . i plan to wear it with short peep toe boots and also with ankle leggings and flats . so glad velvet is in this year !"
__label__-1 "i 'm usually a fan of maeve but this dress is just bad . the fabric is thin and filmy and it stretches to sheer over your chest . the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose it just droops in a most unfortunate way ."
__label__-1 "this open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric . even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it ."
__label__1 "this dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich luxurious fabric a deep neckline and a tightly cinched waist . i have a full bust and while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers for me it is a little miracle . this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size . thank you !"
