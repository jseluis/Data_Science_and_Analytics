### My Quick Lab from Practical Data Science Specialization, Coursera.

[My Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/BT2K6GVW7FPL)

**Project 1 - Amazon Sagemaker - Register and visualize dataset**

Register and visualize dataset

    List and access the Women's Clothing Reviews dataset files hosted in an S3 bucket

    Install and import AWS Data Wrangler

    Create an AWS Glue Catalog database and list all Glue Catalog databases

    Register dataset files with the AWS Glue Catalog

    Write SQL queries to answer specific questions on your dataset and run your queries with Amazon Athena

    Return the query results in a pandas dataframe

    Produce and select different plots and visualizations that address your questions

**Project 2 Detect data bias with Amazon SageMaker Clarify**

    Download and save raw unbalanced dataset

    Analyze bias with open source Clarify

    Balance the dataset

    Analyze bias at scale with a Amazon SageMaker processing job and Clarify

    Analyze bias reports before and after balancing the dataset

**Project 3 Train a model with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot**

    Dataset review

    Configure the Autopilot job

    Launch Autopilot job

    Track Autopilot job progress

    Feature engineering

    Model training and tuning

    Review all output

    Deploy and test best candidate model

**Project 4 Train a text classifier using Amazon SageMaker BlazingText built-in algorithm**

    Prepare dataset

    Train the model with Amazon SageMaker BlazingText

    Deploy the model

    Test the model
