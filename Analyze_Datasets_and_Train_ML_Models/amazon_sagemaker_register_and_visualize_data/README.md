# Amazon Sagemaker - Register and visualize dataset

### My Quick Lab from Practical Data Science Specializastion, Coursera.

Project:

Perform a multiclass classification for sentiment analysis by first ingesting product reviews data into a central repository, Amazon S3 bucket. Then, we will use Amazon Athena and AWS Glue Machine Learning tools to analyze the data and visualize the data with interactive queries, which will be used during the model development process. 

**Steps**

Register and visualize dataset

    List and access the Women's Clothing Reviews dataset files hosted in an S3 bucket

    Install and import AWS Data Wrangler

    Create an AWS Glue Catalog database and list all Glue Catalog databases

    Register dataset files with the AWS Glue Catalog

    Write SQL queries to answer specific questions on your dataset and run your queries with Amazon Athena

    Return the query results in a pandas dataframe

    Produce and select different plots and visualizations that address your questions
