# Optimize models using Automatic Model Tuning

### My Quick Lab from Practical Data Science Specializastion, Coursera.

Project:

When training ML models, hyperparameter tuning is a step taken to find the best performing training model. In this lab you will apply a random algorithm of Automated Hyperparameter Tuning to train a BERT-based natural language processing (NLP) classifier. The model analyzes customer feedback and classifies the messages into positive (1), neutral (0), and negative (-1) sentiments.

**Steps**

1. Configure dataset

2. Configure and run hyper-parameter tuning job

3. Evaluate the results
