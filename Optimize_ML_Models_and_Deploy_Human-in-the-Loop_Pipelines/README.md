[Optimize ML Models and Deploy Human-in-the-Loop Pipelines Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/RN8CLW4W3UJK)

- Project 1 - Optimize models using Automatic Model Tuning

    1. Configure dataset

    2. Configure and run hyper-parameter tuning job

    3. Evaluate the results

- Project 2 A/B testing, traffic shifting and autoscaling

    4. Configure and create REST Enpoint with multiple variants

    5. Test the model

    6. Show the metrics for each variant

    7. Shift all traffic to one variant

    8. Configure one variant to autoscale

- Project 3 Data labeling and human-in-the-loop pipelines with Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)

    9. Setup private workforce and Cognito pool

    10. Create the Human Task UI using a Worker Task Template

    11. Create a Flow Definition

    12. Start and check the status of human loop

    13. Verify the completion

    14. View the labels and prepare data for training
