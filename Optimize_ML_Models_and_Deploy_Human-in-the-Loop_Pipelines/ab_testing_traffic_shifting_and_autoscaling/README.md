# A/B testing, traffic shifting and autoscaling

### My Project from Practical Data Science Specializastion, Coursera.

Project:

Create an endpoint with multiple variants, splitting the traffic between them. Then after testing and reviewing the endpoint performance metrics, you will shift the traffic to one variant and configure it to autoscale.

**Steps**

1. Configure and create REST Enpoint with multiple variants

2. Test the model

3. Show the metrics for each variant

4. Shift all traffic to one variant

5. Configure one variant to autoscale
